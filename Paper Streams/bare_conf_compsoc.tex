\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{float}


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
%背景介绍
%In recent years, personal data have been increasingly collected, stored and analyzed.
%
%The last decade has been the development of a number of privacy definitions and mechanisms that trade-off the privacy of individuals in these databases for the utility of data analysis.\\
%
%Ensuring that these applications do not breach the privacy of individuals is an important problem.\\
%
%With traffic estimation systems or location based services, the main concern is related to the potential possibility for an adversary to obtain information about or even reconstruct a given individual's trajectory from publicly available data.\\
%
%It is therefore urgent to develop practical tools for private releases and analysis of mobility datasets.\\

The last decade has been the development of the information collected 
For example, real-time traffic analysis, 

\textbf{-----Here are the current problems------}\\
In real life, the size of the data stream is unpredictable, and its length may be infinite, the arrival of a steady stream of data over time.\\
However, sharing click streams can lead to serious privacy breaches, such as the notorious AOL privacy scandal, even if the identification of individuals(e.g. IP address or name)\\
The current state-of-the-art paradigm for privacy-preserving data publishing is differential privacy, which requires that the aggregate statistics reported by a data publisher be perturbed by a randomized algorithm \textit{A}, so that the output of \textit{A} remains roughly the same even if any single tuple in the input data is arbitrarily modified. Given the output of \textit{A}, an adversary will not be able to infer much about any single tuple in the input, and thus privacy is protected.\\
Releasing anonymized and aggregate information is not safe because of unforeseen background knowledge.It is hard to model the attacker's background knowledge in this big data.\\
We should propose a privacy model based on differential privacy which make no assumption on the background knowledge of the attacker.\\
A straightforward application of differential privacy mechanism which adds a Laplace noise to each aggregate value at each time stamp can lead to a very high perturbation error due to the composition theorem.\\
The goal of our work is to enable the publisher to share useful aggregate statistics over individual users continuously (aggregate time series) while guaranteeing their privacy.\\

\textit{Question: How can data aggregators continually release updated statistics, and meanwhile preserve each individual user’s privacy and 保护可用性?}

However, existing privacy preserving models mainly depend on the background knowledge of adversaries who may harm the data by re-identifying it.\\
Differential privacy can protect the presence of an individual regardless of the adversary’s background knowledge and give the demarcation of adversary’s ability.
Differential privacy does guarantee privacy against intrusion by any adversary when all the entities in the database are independent.\\
The curator may publish the result on a web site once, and multiple queriers may extract any desired information from the released data (eg., a subset of counts)
Because the original data may contain sensitive information about individuals, publishing it without any changes may compromise privacy.\\
Time series:The production of big personal data in the form of sequences of time-stamped real values, called time-series, stores in the personal devices of the individuals.\\
\textbf{--------what is the relate work -------}
Previous work on differential privacy of streaming data mainly focuses on event-level privacy on finite or infinite streams [13], [14], [11], and user-level privacy on finite streams.\\
\textbf{-----explain user-level and event-level-----}\\
FAST takes as input the total amount of timestamps T, which leads to inapplicability in our infinite scenario.\\
w-event privacy was proposed to make a nice balance between two former privacy definitions.\\
We strongly believe that there are no “universal” sanitization solutions that fit all applications, i.e., provide good accuracy in all scenarios.[2]\\
\textbf{--------what is our novel approach -------}\\
In this paper, we consider...
Towards this end, we introduce a novel schemes\\
How to measure whether spending privacy budget is a worthwhile investment or not?\\
It is important to develop an approximation strategy cooperating with dynamic budget allocation component to raise data utility.\\
Instead of directly adding noise to a real statistics, we function by transformation of original data or a query structure to achieve better overall utility.\\
%不统一分配预算，把预算投入到最需要的地方去。
The goal of our work is to ….\\
\textbf{--------what is our contribution? -----------}\\
\textbf{Contribution: }
The key challenge is to improve the utility of the mechanism while preserving privacy level.\\
In summary, we make the following contributions:\\
We design an Algorithm to dynamically add noise at each timestamp.\\	
\textbf{-----Here are the session arrangement------}\\
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss studies to our own. In Section 3, we cover related work, follow by session 4, where we describe the hardware architecture design. We then...

\subsection{Differential Privacy}
In 2006, Dwork et.al defined the notion of differential privacy. The goal is to publish statistics computed on dataset \(D\), without compromising the privacy of the respondents.\\
Irrespective of whether or not an individual is present in the data set.\\
Differential privacy has recently emerged as the de facto standard for private data release. This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data.\\
How to publicly release statistical information about a set of people without compromising he privacy of any individual.\\
Formally \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy is defined as follows:\\
\textbf{Definition 1(Differential Privacy)}
privacy mechanism \(A\) gives \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy if for any database \(D\) and \(D^{*}\) differing on at most one record, and for any possible output \(O\in Range(A)\)\\

\begin{center}
$\frac{Pr[A(Q(D))]}{Pr[A(Q(D^{*}))]} \leq e^{\varepsilon},\varepsilon>0$
\end{center}
Then \(A\) achieves \(\varepsilon\)-DP, \(\varepsilon\)is a given positive parameter, called privacy budget, used to control unitary privacy level.
\textbf{Definition 2(Laplace Mechanism)[2]}\\
The first and most widely used method for achieving differential privacy is the Laplace mechanism[], which adds random noise following the Laplace distribution to the true answers to the query functions.\\
\(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy can be achieved by adding independent Laplace random noise \(x\) to the answer of query \(Q\). In the following, \(n\) and \(D\) denote the noisy data and a given database, respectively.\\
\begin{center}
$n=Q(D)+x$
\end{center}
\begin{center}
$x\sim(x|\lambda)=\frac{1}{2\lambda}*exp(-|x|/\lambda)$
\end{center}
where \(\lambda\) is a scale parameter of Laplace distribution, which equals to \(GS(Q)/\varepsilon\).\\
\textbf{Definition 3(Global Sensitivity)}\\
For \(f:D \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d}\), the global sensitivity of \(f\) is \(GS_{f} = max_{D \sim D^{'}} \parallel f(D)- f(D^{'} \parallel_{1}\)\\
%说明统计查询的全局敏感度为1
\textbf{Trust assumptions}\\
We assume that the data owner and the service provider are trusted, ant the analyst is untrusted.\\
\subsection{Utility metrics}
We adopt the classical statistical metric of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as shown below:\\
\begin{center}
$ MAE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n|p_i-q_i|}{N}$
\end{center}
\section{Proposed Methods}



\section{Experimental Evaluation}
We have implemented XXX in Java, and used Java Statistical Classes (JSC) to simulating the Laplace distribution.\\
We experimented with two real datasets. First, we in....\\
Second, we use a well-known archived dataset named World Cup. It contains 1,352,804,107 Web server logs from the FIFA 1998 Soccer World Cup website, gather in 88 consecutive days[1].\\
In order to compare the average case, each algorithm runs 50 times then outputs the average results.\\

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed XXX. The key innovation is that our approach...\\
Publishing accurate trajectories may cause serious privacy breach since such data reveals movement behavior.\\

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
